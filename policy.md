## Open–source policy

We derive inspiration from [other public sector open-source policies](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md) while also considering the [values of our organization](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/about/values.page). Much of the code that we use and share is publicly available on GitHub within the [@CityOfNewYork](https://github.com/cityofnewyork/) and [@NYCOpportunity](https://github.com/NYCOpportunity) organizations. For us, the benefits of being an open-source organization are as follows.

* Working in public creates mutual benefit, shared understanding, and learning with the civic tech community.

* We can support other organizations and city agencies that may be attempting to deliver services with similar technologies.

* It keeps us accountable to our core principle of equity allowing others to take advantage of resources to work to their fullest potential.

We also maintain public APIs and datasets, particularly the **NYC Benefits Platform** which comprises the [Screening API](https://screeningapidocs.cityofnewyork.us/) and [Benefits and Programs Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Benefits-and-Programs-API/kvhd-5fmu) hosted on the NYC Open Data Portal.

### Use of open–source

NYC Opportunity benefits from the availability of open-source software. Particularly,

* The [WordPress Content Management System](https://wordpress.org/), [plugin ecosystem](https://wordpress.org/plugins/), [PHP programming language](https://www.php.net/), and [PHP package ecosystem (Packagist)](https://packagist.org/).

* [Node.js programming language](https://nodejs.org/) and packages on the [Node.js package registry (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/).

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming languages.

* Design Patterns such as the [NYC Core Framework](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doitt/html/nyc-core-framework/index.html) and the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/).

* Open-source graphics and typography such as [Noto Fonts](https://www.google.com/get/noto/), [Public Sans](https://public-sans.digital.gov/), and [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/).

* And much, much more.

Attribution to other’s freely shared work should be considered, whether explicitly or indirectly. Examples of explicit attribution include crediting text and links to sources on our public-facing sites, repository, or wherever the work is used. Indirect attribution includes stating a work as a dependency in a publicly visible package manager file (such as package.json).

### Position

Team members may choose to work in private or public repositories. There may be many reasons why someone chooses to work in private whether it be for an extra layer of security or they feel more confident publicly releasing something in a more finished state. However, we encourage everyone to try working in public.

### Community

#### Internal

When contributing to a project the team considers how the contribution will not only benefit and sustain the project but also the team. This consideration has a broader impact on how we share our code as well.

* Contributions should strive to be reusable with as few barriers to implementation as possible.

* Documentation should be done proactively, not retroactively, and should consider the broadest reading audience possible.

* Condescending tone, exclusive terms, and assumptions about understanding should also be avoided in source code and documentation.

* Standards are highly respected and valued but should not prevent us from adhering to our principles.

#### External

We encourage those aware of our open–source work to ask questions or contribute constructively to our open–source projects where they are hosted (GitHub). We expect that those who wish to engage in the work also adhere to the principles illustrated here.

Unfortunately, we do not have the capacity to accommodate feature requests although the sharing of constructive ideas is highly encouraged.

### Open-source licenses

The [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) is preferred though it is not a requirement for all of our software.
